## Project
This project aims to run a Desktop OS on an Android Phone.

## Getting started
There are two ways to virtualize on an android phone:
- [Linux virtualization](/linux) -> using a software that virtualizes a Linux OS on android
- [Nested virtualization](/nested) -> also known as VMception, allows you to run any os on android but with low performance.
